<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## <strong>Design</strong>

On this project, I used one of the frondendmentor challenge as reference. I followed the jpeg files to code as close as possible to reference design.

<br/>

## <strong>Features</strong>

- Autoplay: The timer follows pomodoro technique's original order unless you pause the timer or select the stage manually.
- Notification Sound: Once a stage is completed, next stage keeps running with a notification sound between each stage.
- Settings Modal: If you don't wish to follow original pomodoro durations, you're able to set custom durations of each stage.
- Progress bar: Circular progress bar allows you to see remaining time visually.

<br/>

## <strong>Built With</strong>

This project developed with React and styled with Tailwindcss.
